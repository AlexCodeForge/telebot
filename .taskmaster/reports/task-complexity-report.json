		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Laravel Project with Telegram Bot Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Laravel and Telegram bot integration into subtasks such as: initializing the Laravel project, installing the Telegram SDK, configuring environment variables, registering service providers, creating a TelegramController, implementing basic send message and send video methods, testing bot connectivity, and setting up the webhook for updates.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple setup steps across Laravel and Telegram, including SDK installation, environment configuration, controller creation, and webhook setup. Each step is distinct and requires careful configuration and testing, making it moderately complex and suitable for expansion into at least 7 subtasks.[1][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Schema for Videos",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks such as: creating the migration for the videos table, implementing the Video model, defining validation rules, running the migration, and creating a seeder with sample data.",
			"reasoning": "Designing and implementing a database schema in Laravel is a standard process involving migration, model, validation, and seeding. The steps are straightforward but require attention to detail, justifying a moderate complexity and 5 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Video CRUD Admin Interface",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the admin interface into subtasks: creating the VideoController with resource methods, building views for listing/creating/editing, implementing video upload to Telegram and file_id storage, adding form fields and validation, handling flash messages, and manual testing.",
			"reasoning": "While CRUD interfaces are common, integrating Telegram uploads and handling file_id storage adds complexity. The task covers both backend and frontend elements, warranting 7 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Stripe Payment Gateway",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: installing Stripe SDK, configuring API keys, creating PaymentController, implementing session creation, handling success/cancel redirects, processing webhooks, setting up payment routes, and creating the purchases table.",
			"reasoning": "Stripe integration involves SDK setup, secure configuration, controller logic, webhook handling, and database updates. Each step is critical for secure payment processing, making this a higher complexity task with at least 8 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Adapt Frontend from telebot.html Template",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks: analyzing the telebot.html template, creating a Blade layout, implementing the video catalog view, adding purchase and Telegram username forms, integrating Stripe Checkout buttons, ensuring mobile responsiveness, and adding message displays.",
			"reasoning": "Adapting an existing template and integrating dynamic content and payment buttons requires both design and development work, justifying a moderate complexity and 7 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Stripe Webhook Handler",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: creating a webhook route, exempting from CSRF, verifying Stripe signatures, handling checkout.session.completed events, extracting customer and video data, updating purchase status, triggering Telegram delivery, and implementing error handling/logging.",
			"reasoning": "Webhook handling is sensitive and must be robust, involving security, data extraction, and integration with other systems. This complexity warrants at least 8 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Telegram Video Delivery System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks: extending TelegramController, implementing a delivery service class, creating the send video function, adding retry logic, logging deliveries, updating purchase records, sending confirmation messages, handling edge cases, and testing with various scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Automated delivery via Telegram involves asynchronous operations, error handling, retries, and integration with payment and user systems. The need for reliability and traceability increases complexity, suggesting at least 9 subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "End-to-End Testing and Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: setting up the test environment, creating user journey test cases, testing error scenarios, optimizing queries and APIs, configuring error logging, documenting setup, preparing deployment scripts, and validating PRD requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing and deployment require coordination across all components, covering functional, edge case, and performance testing, as well as documentation and deployment preparation. This justifies 8 subtasks."
